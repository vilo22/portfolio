            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>Well since I came out of high school last year I've been working on different jobs, customer service, construction, tech support, it's been hard for me to get scholarships because I'm not a citizen so since my graduation I've been trying to save money, work and learn from every nre experience. My last job was as a monitor on the new TI construction, a clean room. Clean rooms are basically factories to build microchips; I thought it was interesting that TI was investing a lot on that factory... that's when I realized that the future it's on these type of jobs, So I thought "ok I'm young and I respect the construction field, but this is not for me"  </p>
